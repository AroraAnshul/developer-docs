title: Resolution Support
excerpt: App support for different resolution displays.
---

Apps built for the Raydiant platform can be displayed on different resolution displays.
This article aims to provide guidance for developers that are navigating the complexities
of building apps for different resolution displays.

## Terminology

Raydiant uses these resolution names throughout this article:

<SimpleTable
  headers={['Name', 'Resolution']}
  rows={[
    ['720p', '1280x720'],
    ['1080p', '1920x1080'],
    ['4K', '3840x2160'],
    ['8K', '7680x4320'],
  ]}
/>

## Resolutions Support

Raydiant devices have limited support for some resolutions:

<SimpleTable
  headers={['Media Type', '720p', '1080p', '4K', '8K']}
  rows={[
    ['Image', 'Supported', 'Supported', 'Supported', 'Planned Support*'],
    ['Video', 'Supported', 'Supported', 'Partially Supported*', 'Planned Support*'],
  ]}
/>


\* Trying to use this media most likely will result in a poor user experience.

## Multizone

Multizone is an app that allows combining different apps on one display.
Below is an image that show Multizone in action:

Different apps are shown on different sections of the display.
Even if the display is 1080p it doesn’t mean that your app will
get full 1920x1080 to be displayed on.
Example where you can see Multizone app that uses two other apps
in red squares that are given portion of the display:

Our recommendations are:
* Do not assume that 720p is the lowest resolution that your app might be playing on.
* Do not rely on different resolution breakpoints. Prefer making calculations that are continuous in nature like: "window.clientwidth / 720" which would give you a continuous range of values and would work well for Multizone.
* Do not assume that 1080p is the highest resolution. Even though it is the only one fully supported resolution, Raydiant is moving forward with higher resolution support.

## Testing

Apps should be tested with:
* Different resolutions.
* Different display orientations like: landscape, portrait.
* Multizone

Different resolutions can be simulated using Chrome developer tools:

1. Open developer tools.
2. Select "Toggle device toolbar".

3. To add desired resolutions click dimensions dropdown.

4. Click "Edit".

5. Click "Add custom device...".

6. Enter device information and click "Add". Device pixel ratio should be set to 1.

7. Select desired resolution.

## Styling Recommendations

### CSS Units

Prefer using "vw", "vh", "vmax", "vmin" units.
Since these units depend on the actual screen.

"em" units are relative to the parent element font size meaning that "2em" would be "32px"
if the parent element has font size set to "16px".
Having this in mind, "em" units can be used as long as the parent element has font size
that is relative to the display resolution.

"rem" units are similar to "em" units but they are relative to the font size of the root element.

Other units are **not recommended** since on different resolutions elements might look different.

### Display Orientation

For better control over element sizes CSS media queries can be used for different display orientations.
Example:

```css
@media(orientation: portrait) {
  html {
    font-size: 10vh;
  }
}


@media(orientation: landscape) {
  html {
    font-size: 10vw;
  }
}
```

### Font Sizes

Prefer using “vw”, “vh”, “vmax”, “vmin” units for font size.

This is how text looks with different font size unit on the same piece of display:

<SimpleTable
  headers={['Font Size', '720p', '1080p', '4K', '8K']}
  rows={[
    ['2vw', <Image src={'/docs-static/4k-font-size-2vw-720p.png'} alt='2vw 720p' />, <Image src={'/docs-static/4k-font-size-2vw-1080p.png'} alt='2vw 1080p' />, <Image src={'/docs-static/4k-font-size-2vw-4K.png'} alt='2vw 4K' />, <Image src={'/docs-static/4k-font-size-2vw-8K.png'} alt='2vw 8K' />],
    ['32px', <Image src={'/docs-static/4k-font-size-32px-720p.png'} alt='32px 720p' />, <Image src={'/docs-static/4k-font-size-32px-1080p.png'} alt='32px 1080p' />, <Image src={'/docs-static/4k-font-size-32px-4K.png'} alt='32px 4K' />, <Image src={'/docs-static/4k-font-size-32px-8K.png'} alt='32px 8K' />],
    ['8mm', <Image src={'/docs-static/4k-font-size-8mm-720p.png'} alt='8mm 720p' />, <Image src={'/docs-static/4k-font-size-8mm-1080p.png'} alt='8mm 1080p' />, <Image src={'/docs-static/4k-font-size-8mm-4K.png'} alt='8mm 4K' />, <Image src={'/docs-static/4k-font-size-8mm-8K.png'} alt='8mm 8K' />],
  ]}
/>

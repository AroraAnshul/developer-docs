The Raydiant Developer Platform is in private beta, if you are interested in building an app sign up at [raydiant.com/developers](https://www.raydiant.com/developers/) and we’ll be in touch.

A developer account will give you access to both the Raydiant Dashboard and the Developer Portal.

## Raydiant Dashboard

The [Raydiant Dashboard](https://dash.raydiant.com) is where you can create playlists of content and publish them to your devices.

When you build a Raydiant app it will be available in the Dashboard, allowing you to test your app’s inputs, how it behaves in a playlist and publish it to a device.

## Developer Portal

The [Developer Portal](https://developers.raydiant.com) is where you can create and manage all your Raydiant apps as well as create API keys for our On-Brand Menu API.

You can also submit your application to our App Marketplace to share your application with thousands of Raydiant users.

### Multi-zone

Multi-zone is an app that allows combining different apps on one display.
Different apps are shown on different sections of the display.
Even if the display is 1080p it doesnâ€™t mean that your app will
get full 1920x1080 to be displayed on.

Make sure to test your app using Multi-zone resolutions.
Resolutions can be changed using Chrome
[developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/).
Devices with different resolutions can be simulated using this
[guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/).
